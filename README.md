This is the official repository associated to the paper **Reanalyzing gene-expression data from a causal perspective**

Differential expression and co-expression analysis, pathway analysis, and dimensional reduction techniques are usual ways of processing gene expression data.
As a result, we obtain sets of differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways, which are assumed to underly the main biological processes in the system under study.  
In the present paper, we revisit gene-expression data by looking at it from a causal perspective.
